        % Your abstract text here
        Oblivious algorithms have been a popular research topic in cybersecurity due to its resistance to side channel attacks. We implemented a parallel oblivious sorting algorithm in C++ using Intel SGX Enclave, a hardware-based trusted-computing environment. We leveraged OpenMP to achieve multithreading on a 36-core CPU and further improved parallelism through SIMD. We parallelized both the in-enclave computation and the communication with untrusted memory. Our implementation achieves a speedup of 7.5x over the original serial implementation with 8 threads and 16x with 32 threads.

      \begin{block}{Background of Intel SGX}
        % Background of Intel SGX text here
        Intel SGX is a hardware-based trusted-computing environment, which provides a protected region of memory, known as the Enclave Page Cache (EPC). EPC has limited size, and the communication between EPC and untrusted memory is time-consuming. Therefore, it is important to minimize the amount of data swapped in and out of EPC.

      \begin{block}{Background of Oblivious Sorting Algorithms}
        % Background of Oblivious Sorting Algorithms text here
      Oblivious algorithms ensure that memory access and page swap patterns are independent of secret data, thereby resists side channel attacks.

      \begin{block}{Background of Flex-way Butterfly Oblivious Sort}
        % Background of Flex-way Butterfly Oblivious Sort text here
        To achieve oblivious sorting, Flex-way Butterfly Oblivious Sort applies a random shuffling algorithm followed by a non-oblivious comparison-based sorting algorithm. The key component of the shuffling algorithm is a multi-way butterfly network, emulated with a building block called Merge-split. The algorithm ensures negligible overflow probability and achieves optimal complexity in terms of both computation and I/O.
